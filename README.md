Analysis of Water Quality in Dry Creek Exerpimental Watershed (DCEW)

Created: November 3, 2024

Summary

The goals of the scripts in this repository are to 1) compile water quality data for streamflow in DCEW from 2023 to 2024 and 2) understand how water quality changes in a watershed

Steps to running drain analysis:

01_wq_compiledatal.ipynb: This script combines all existing water quality data for DCEW so that the data formating is consistent for later analysis. 

02_wq_figures.ipynb: Creates a linear regression of water quality variables versus distance from outlet and compares water quality metrics through time.
